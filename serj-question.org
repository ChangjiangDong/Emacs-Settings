Hi Serj,

Can you take a look at the function replace-smart-quotes

This is mostly working as I want it to, except for two things:

First, this line:

: (" - " . "---")


This works correctly most of the time. For instance, if I have a sentence like this:

: This is the most important thing - to be a good person.

It correctly changes it to this:

: This is the most important thing---to be a good person.

However, I want to make it do this ONLY when it is NOT at the beginning of a line.

Currently, if I have a line like this:

:   - this is a bullet item

It incorrectly gets replaced with this:
:  ---this is a bullet item

That's not what I want.

Can you adjust the function so that it replaces " - " with "---" ONLY when there is other text at the beginning of the line?

Also, can you add a that deletes the string "- " but ONLY IF it comes in the middle of a word, like this:
: spac- es

So that again, bullet items like this:
: - this is a bullet item

...are unaffected?

Thanks!!
