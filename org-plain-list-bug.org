Org-mode defines a plain list items as lines beginning with a hyphen and then a space, like this:

- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

^

My setup is designed to detect whether the cursor is on a plain-text list item or not, i.e. whether the current line begins with a hyphen followed by a space, and to behave differently accordingly.

When org-mode detects that the cursor is on a line that's a plain-text list item, a certain behavior is desired:
- <RET> inserts a return and then automatically adds a hyphen and space on the next line, i.e. it automatically adds another plain list item. (Hitting RET again exits out of the plain list and takes you to a blank line.)

This works correctly.

However, I'm experiencing undesired behavior in the case where the cursor is on a blank line two lines after the last plain list item---in other words, if you imagine that the carat character above ^ is not a character at all, but rather represents the cursor.

So let's go through two scenarios. Again let's say the carat ^ represents the cursor, not an actual character.

Scenario A: the cursor is on a blank line after the last plain list item:
- item 1
- item 2
- item 3
^

In this first scenario...
- current behavior: RET inserts a plain list item on the current line
- desired behavior: same same
- current behavior: M-RET inserts a plain list item on the current line
- desired behavior: same
- current behavior: RET RET adds two blank lines
- desired behavior: same

Now let's consider the problematic scenario.

Scenario B: the cursor is on a blank line after the last plain list item:
- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

^

In this second scenario...
- current behavior: RET goes *up* one line and adds a plain list item
- desired behavior: insert line break
- current behavior: m-RET goes *up* one line and adds a plain list item
- desired behavior: m-RET inserts an org-heading
- current behavior: RET RET first inserts a plain list item, then removes it again
- desired behavior: RET RET inserts two line breaks

I see a couple mentions of org-mode's so called plain-text list in my Emacs configuration, [[https://github.com/incandescentman/emacs-settings/blob/master/shared-functions.org#org-setup][here]], [[https://github.com/incandescentman/Emacs-Settings/blob/master/gnu-emacs-startup.org#org-predicates][here]], [[https://github.com/incandescentman/Emacs-Settings/blob/master/gnu-emacs-startup.org#smart-org-meta-return-dwim][here]], and [[https://github.com/incandescentman/Emacs-Settings/blob/master/gnu-emacs-startup.org#smart-org-meta-return-dwim][here]].
