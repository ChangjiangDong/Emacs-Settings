* TODO [#C] JavaScript?
Hi RÃºdi,

Do you know JavaScript? If you're interested, I might have some very quick JavaScript questions. for example the below, which comes from here:
[[http://www.devontechnologies.com/download/extras-and-manuals.html][Install browser extensions and bookmarklets, and read the help files as PDFs or ebooks - DEVONtechnologies]]

I believe it's the bookmarklet labeled "Text"

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
javascript:window.location='x-devonthink://createText?location='+encodeURIComponent(window.location)+'&text='+encodeURIComponent(getSelection()); 
#+END_SRC

It works correctly to capture text from Chrome and insert it into a tool called DevonThink. Ideally I'd like it to automatically return me to Chrome again when it's done instead of leaving me in DevonThink. Straightforward? Thanks!
