** TODO [#B] JavaScript?                                        :javascript:
Hi Rúdi,

Do you know JavaScript? If you're interested, I might have some very quick JavaScript questions. for example the below, which comes from here:
[[http://www.devontechnologies.com/download/extras-and-manuals.html][Install browser extensions and bookmarklets, and read the help files as PDFs or ebooks - DEVONtechnologies]]

I believe it's the bookmarklet labeled "Text"

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
javascript:window.location='x-devonthink://createText?location='+encodeURIComponent(window.location)+'&text='+encodeURIComponent(getSelection()); 
#+END_SRC

It works correctly to capture text from Chrome and insert it into a tool called DevonThink. Ideally I'd like it to automatically return me to Chrome again when it's done instead of leaving me in DevonThink. Straightforward? Thanks!

*** TODO [#A] speed up launch?                                      :emacs:
Hi Rúdi,

I'd like to make Emacs launch faster, so that I can launch and just start typing text in org-mode as fast as possible when I need to start typing quickly. (Say I get a phone call and I need to take down a number, etc.) Can we set it up so that as much as possible gets lazy-loaded or loads after launch? 

Also in shared-functions.org, I have lines like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(load "~/Dropbox/github/koma3/ox-koma-letter.el")
(load "~/Dropbox/github/koma3/fiverr-koma.el") 
#+END_SRC

It's my own customized version of ox-koma letter, but it certainly doesn't need to launch right away. I use it rarely...

Thanks!

**** NOTE-TO-JAY Answer

    Well, I can think of two ways to speed up launch:

    1. Autoloading as much as possible. Here's [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Autoload.html][info]] on it. In the example you gave, you'd probably write something like: 
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (autoload 'org-koma-letter-export-as-latex "~/Dropbox/github/koma3/ox-koma-letter.el" nil t)
    ...
    #+END_EXAMPLE
    This registers the command ~org-koma-letter-export-as-latex~ as loadable from the latter path. This of course has the downside of having to specify all commands of a module discriminately so that the module gets loaded when one of those commands is invoked.

    2. Having a separate "vanilla" configuration, which you could start Emacs with when you wanted to start typing fast. You could then have different icons on your desktop: one for your heavyweight Emacs, and another for your vanilla one.

    What do you find more appealing?

**** NOTE-TO-RÚDI Answer
Definitely #1. For this particular functionality, I decided to just move those files into my load path. But anything else we can do to lazy-load other functionality or eval after launch of Emacs would be great! :-)

**** NOTE-TO-JAY Answer

    OK, I've been doing some research on autoloading (I didn't know much about it myself), and it turns out that Emacs pretty much handles it in a very straightforward way -- as long as you use the packages facility in a different way.

    Currently, this is your setting:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(require 'package)

(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("marmalade" .
               "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/" ))
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)

(add-to-list 'package-archives '("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/") t)

(add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/") t)

;; (package-initialize)

(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

(package-initialize 'noactivate)
#+END_EXAMPLE

    By the look of it, I would assume you once had your installed packages initalised and loaded, and then for some reason you preferred to disable loading the packages upon initialisation. Do you remember why?

    The reason I'm asking is that when you install packages and activate them at startup, Emacs automatically does the "autoload" trick; i.e. it defines only the commands, and defers loading of the actual code to when the commands are used. When you use ~require~, Emacs will force the load of all of the package's code.

    So, two options now:

    1. Revert back to activating packages upon ~package-initialize~ and remove ~require~ calls.

    2. Replace ~require~ calls with ~package-activate~.

    This still doesn't solve the cases where you explicitly ~load~ or ~load-file~; we will handle them later.

**** NOTE-TO-RÚDI Answer
OK great. I don't remember why I did that before. I'm not sure the difference between the two options you listed above, so I am fine with either one. It seems like #1 might be a little easier?

*** TODO kill-line-and-capitalize
Can you add something like this: 

(save-excursion
    (when (my/beginning-of-sentence-p)
      (capitalize-word 1))))

to kill-word and kill-clause? Thanks! 

*** TODO [#A] my/delete-backward-and-capitalize 
See my note the end of gnu-emacs-startup.org. 

*** TODO [#B] smart-punctuation when there's already a misplaced punctuation mark?
Can we adjust the behavior of smart-punctuation somewhat for the edge case of dealing with a sentence that already has a misplaced punctuation mark (i.e. there's a space between the word and the punctuation mark.

Example:

: You might have a conscious intention to eat healthier , but you forget.

Say the point is on the comma. 

Current behavior: no effect.

Desired behavior: 
: You might have a conscious intention to eat healthier, but you forget.

*** TODO [#B] Create an auto-capitalization-exceptions-list?
I'd like to create a plain-text list of words that are exceptions to auto-capitalization. So for e.g. if I type e.g. like I have in this sentence, I don't want the next word to be automatically capitalized. 

See this: 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq auto-capitalize-predicate
      (lambda () (not (looking-back "\\([Ee]\\.g\\|[Uu]\\.S\\|[Ii]\\.e\\|\\.\\.\\)\\.[^.]*" (- (point) 20)))))
#+END_SRC

I'd like to be able to keep this list and add to it in a plain text format. I'm asking because I want to add the word "vs." to the list (e.g. good vs. evil) but I couldn't get the regexp correct with all the slash escaping. 

It would be easier if I could have something like this: 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq *auto-capitalize-exceptions*
  (list "e.g." "i.e. " "vs.")) 
#+END_SRC

Thanks!
